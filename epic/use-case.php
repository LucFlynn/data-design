		<h1> A very Bad Etsy Site</h1>
	</head>

		<h2> Use Case </h2>
	<p>Kim has read on the internet, while using her mac and iphone, about a very bad etsy site. She always enjoyed etsy for her product needs but has an 'internet' sense of humor. The ability to favorite things but not actually buy them tickles her. She typically logs on when she's tired of instagram and twitter, doesn't have any money to actually spend or is looking for inspiration on what to buy. She gets a jolt from window shopping and imagining how products could be used in her life. And sometimes she finds things she didn't even know she needed. In this case she typically favorites the item to show off to herself or to save for purchasing elsewhere later.</p>

		<h2> Interaction Flow</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> I login through chrome</li>
			<li> A.V.B.E. redirects to home page whit previously favorited products</li>
			<li> I Hit "browse products"</li>
			<li> A.V.B.E. Takes me to "channels" page with more specified product genres along with 'random' </li>
			<li> I click random</li>
			<li> A.V.B.E. redirects to a random item with a 'favorite' or 'skip' button</li>
			<li> I push favorite</li>
			<li> A.V.B.E. takes favoirite and stores it in favorite entity, presents another product</li>
